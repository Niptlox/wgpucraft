# Multiplayer Test Plan (placeholder)

Multiplayer features are not wired up yet. This document will track the local 2× client + server test matrix once the networking milestone lands:
- Launch dedicated server/listen-server.
- Connect two clients with distinct names/head colors.
- Verify player replication (position/rotation/block actions) and nameplate visibility when aiming at a player.

Status: to be filled in alongside the networking implementation.
